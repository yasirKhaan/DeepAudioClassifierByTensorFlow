# DeepAudioClassifierByTensorFlow

# # Classification Of Voice Of Capuchin Bird

Here in this project we will try to classify BIRD CALL in audio. And also check for DENSITY OF BIRD CALL in each audio.

We will process audio by using tensorflow audio processing libraries.

Tensorflow audio processing libraries will give as WAVEFORMS which we will later convert into SPECTROGRAM.

We will push SPECTROGRAM into Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
